The name **Metis** is taken from the Greek goddess of wisdom, Metis, which is a collection of application practices in the AIOps field. It mainly solves the problem of intelligent operation and maintenance in terms of quality, efficiency and cost. The current version of the open source time series anomaly detection learnware is to solve the anomaly detection problem of time series data from the perspective of machine learning.

The realization of the time series anomaly detection learnware is based on statistical judgment, unsupervised and supervised learning to jointly detect time series data. The first-level decision is made by statistical judgment and unsupervised algorithm, and the suspected abnormality is output. Secondly, the supervised model is judged, and the final test result is obtained. The detection model is generated through a large number of sample training and can be continuously updated according to the sample.

The time series anomaly detection learnware has been covered in **20w+** Zhiyun server, which carries the abnormality detection of **240w+** service indicators. After extensive monitoring and data polishing, the learnware has a wide range of applications in the field of anomaly detection and operation and maintenance monitoring.
